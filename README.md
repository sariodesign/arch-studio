## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

1. View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
2. See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
3. Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Your Message` fields are empty should show "Can't be empty"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
**Bonus**: View actual locations on the locations page maps (we recommend [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/) for this)
